# SURF_EMNLP17
Java Implementation of Author-aware Aspect Topic Sentiment Model as described in our paper:

Poddar, Lahari, Wynne Hsu, and Mong Li Lee. "Author-aware Aspect Topic Sentiment Model to Retrieve Supporting Opinions from Reviews." Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. 2017.

Currently the uploaded project contains the implementations of Author-ATS model (parametric, non-parametric) and the baseline ATS model. Paths to input folders must be mentioned in the config file residing in the resources directory.

Please cite the paper if you use our implementation. 

Thanks,
